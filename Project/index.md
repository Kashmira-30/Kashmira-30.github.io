# Deforestation within the Brazilian Amazon Boundary Analysis
## Description
The following maps analyze deforestation throughout the years of conservation sites, Indigenous reserves, and the general Brazilian Amazon. Firstly, we can see that from the years 2001 -2003 there is greater rate of deforestation seen than that of the years 2013 â€“ 2015. This is likely due to many interventions by the government. In the following maps, the conservation sites have a decline of deforestation of about 37% while the Indigenous reserves have about a 14% by the years 2013-2015. Overall, within the Amazon boundary in Brazil, the maps reveal a slow decrease in deforestation. For clarification, the green areas are not growing forests but rather areas which have already been deforested. These maps also do not account for reforestation, but it is assumed that within this 15 year period some trees were planted. 

### Data
The data of deforestation is provided by the PRODES project which has been providing deforestation data since 1988 of this region. The data for the conservation sites, Indigenous reserves, and boundary of the Brazilian Amazon are provided by the Terrabrasilis website. The conservation sites include different types of areas like forests, parks, reserves, etc. According to the "Indigenous land rights and deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management" article, the Indigenous reserves have been implemented before and after the 2000s according to the, but the data from the Terrabrasilis site does not give the specific years. This data was processed by taking the areas within the 2013 to 2015 interval and dividing it by the area from the 2001 to 2003 interval to show the percentage of how much deforestation has declined. The data computed indicates that government interventions of clearcutting forests has helped to decline deforestation between the years 2001 to 2015. 
##### * One very important note is that the area of green is NOT Forest, this is the area in which forest areas have been cutdown. So the decrease in this area over time shows that deforestation has decreased in the Brazilian Amazon within this decade of time (2001 -2015).

### Transformations
For this project, many steps were taken into making the maps. First, by using the attribute tables within the vector layers, I was able to seperate the deforestation dates into 3 year intervals. Then by symbolizing it, the extent of deforestation from 2001 to 2015 could be made. The projection stayed at ESPG 3857 by default. The conservation sites and Indigenous reserves were applied to the maps. With the 3 year intervals, I located the areas of deforestation within the sites and reserves for the (2001-2003) and (20013-2015) intervals to show how deforestation has decreased over the decade. By doing this, we can see how deforestation has occures within parts of the protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. 

### Conclusion
The maps are useful in showing the deforestation in brazil during that decade, it shows when deforestation was more and less intense. To continue this project, I'd like to find more data on the specific years the reserves were established, data on the current situations, and data on land use.

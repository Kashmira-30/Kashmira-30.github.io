# Deforestation within the Brazilian Amazon Boundary Analysis
## Description

The following maps analyze deforestation throughout the years of conservation sites, Indigenous reserves, and the general Brazilian Amazon. The data of deforestation is provided by the PRODES project. Firstly, we can see that from the years 2001 -2003 there is greater rate of deforestation seen than that of the years 2013 – 2015. This likely due to many interventions by the government. The data for the conservation sites, Indigenous reserves, and boundary of the Brazilian Amazon are provided by the Terrabrasilis website. The conservation sites include different types like forests, parks, reserves, etc. The Indigenous reserves have been implemented before and after the 2000s according to the, “Indigenous land rights and deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon” article, but the data does not give the specific years. In the following maps, the conservation sites have a decline of deforestation of about 37% while the Indigenous reserves have about a 14% by the years 2013-2015. This data was processed by taking the areas within the 2013 to 2015 interval and dividing it by the area from the 2001 to 2003 interval to show the percentage of how much deforestation has declined. The data computed indicates that government interventions of clearcutting forests has helped to decline deforestation between the years 2001 to 2015.

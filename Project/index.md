# Project 1
## Description
<This project was a lab assignment from GES 386. We analyzed the surface elevation in Antarctica and many more. 
 The picture shown below is the bed rock regions. Arcmap was the tool we used to work with the spatial data. 
 With arcmap we were able to use functions like extracting by mask and turning the layer into a hillshade for better presentation of the elevation. 
 In the image below, we focused on the bed rock regions and what elevations they were at.>

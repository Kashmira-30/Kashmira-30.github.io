## Topic: Hurricanes

Where to get data: The data I'm thinking of using will most likely come from NOAA, depending what I can find. If possible I'm thinking of finding data across the year 2020 on the number of hurricanes off the Eastern Coast of the U.S. 
#### Possible links: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/

#### Transformations
Depending of what data I find, the transformations will be done basd on it.
#### Analysis 
I want to analysize the number of hurricanes to have hit the area and categorize it according to the severity and windspeed. I also want to look at the paths of the hurricanes and what areas were effected the most. This could be done by making buffers along the area of landfall of the hurricanes.  In addition i also want to look at other tropical storms that have been recorded.
#### Outputs
I want my final output to be a map of the tropical storms and show impact areas as well as map the severity of the certain storms.

## Topic: Hurricanes
(I'm honestly still very unsure, but so far this is the topic that has been in my interest)

Where to get data: The data I'm thinking of using will most likely come from NOAA, depending what I can find. If possible I'm thinking of finding data across the years (I'm debating between just the year 2020 or more in a certain time scale) on the how hurricanes effected the Eastern Coast of the U.S. This could include looking at the populaion and income of different demographics and then comparing it to the property damage.

- #### Possible links for hurricane data: (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/) , (https://mapcruzin.com/natural-disaster-shapefiles/hurricane-arcgis-shapefile-download.htm) , https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/index.php?season=2020&basin=epac 

- #### Possible links for Census data: (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) 

### Transformations
Depending of what data I find, the transformations will be done based on it.

### Analysis 
I want to analysize the damage that hurricanes in the area have effected the population. I also want to look at the paths of the hurricanes and what areas were effected the most. This could be done by making buffers along the area of landfall of the hurricanes. In addition I also want to look at other tropical storms that have been recorded.

### Outputs
I want my final output to be a map of the tropical storms and show impact areas as well as map the severity of the certain storms.

## Topic: Brazil Amazon Deforestation
(I'm honestly still very unsure, but so far this is the topic that has been in my interest)

Where to get data: The data I'm thinking of using will most likely come from various sites, depending what I can find. If possible I'm thinking of finding data across the years (I'm debating between just the year 2020 or more in a certain time scale) on the how deforestation has impacted the Amazon and Indigenous Reserves. This could include looking at how much vegetation is lost within the time intervals and how much of tit is within Indigenous reserves.

### Transformations
Depending of what data I find, the transformations will be done based on it. I think with the data I've found, I'll have to categorize the years and ahow the progression of deforestation. I'll add the areas of the boundary of the Brazilian amazon and also the Indigenous reserves. I'll use a certain projection, maybe ESPG 4326 - WGS 84.

### Analysis 
I want to analysize the loss of the Vegetation within the years that the data provides. I also want to relate this to the the reserves and what effect it has on the people of the reserve. 
### Outputs
I want my final output to be a map of the progression of deforestation through the years of the Amazon and its impact on the reserves as well as to show rates of the deforestation.

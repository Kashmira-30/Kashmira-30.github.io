# Project 2
## Description
This project was the first lab assignment in GES 386. This lab allowed us to explore arcmap more and learn the different tools. We learned how to use the geoprocessing tools  like extraxting tools. Maryland was extracted from a map of the states and the water was cut out so we could show the population densities of a particular state (MD) compared to the entire country. Included is a map below that also shows some of the basic functions we used working with the data. We learned to project the layers to the correct area and also label the data. This map labels the volcanoes in the Western half of the United States.
